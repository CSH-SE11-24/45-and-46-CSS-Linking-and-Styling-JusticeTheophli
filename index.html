  <h1>Great Banger Lyrics</h1>
  <h2>Skater Boy</h2>
  <h3>By Avril Lavigne</h3>
  <p>He was a boy</p>
  <p>She was a girl</p>
  <p>Can I make it any more obvious?</p>
  <p>He was a punk</p>
  <p>She did ballet</p>
  <p>What more can I say?</p>

  <h2>Love Story</h2>
  <h3>By Taylor Swift</h3>
  <p>We were both young when I first saw you</p>
  <p>I close my eyes and the flashback starts</p>
  <p>I'm standin' there</p>
  <p>On a balcony in summer air</p>

  <h2>Fireflies</h2>
  <h3>By Owl City</h3>
  <p>You would not believe your eyes</p>
  <p>If ten million fireflies</p>
  <p>Lit up the world as I fell asleep</p>
  <p>'Cause they fill the open air</p>
  <p>And leave teardrops everywhere</p>
  <p>You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare</p>
</body>
